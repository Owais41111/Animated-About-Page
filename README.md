- **Social Media Buttons**: These buttons link to LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook profiles.

### CSS Styling:
- **Animations**: Various animations such as `openBox`, `fadeImg`, and `showDisc` are used for the entrance and transition effects.
- **Buttons**: Social media buttons have hover effects with color transitions and scaling animations.
